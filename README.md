Above is the link to get the Unity build of the AI Maze game

This game was made in collaboration by Ethan Gladen, Tracy Potter, and Jacob Aguilar

In this 1v1 maze race, it’s a battle of wits as you and your opponent compete to clear the maze first. But there’s a twist: 
you’re not only racing to the finish line — an enemy is also tracking you down. 
To stay ahead, you can swap between different mazes, each offering its own challenges.
Along the way, power-ups are scattered throughout the maze, giving you the chance to gain an advantage or slow down your opponent.

Controls:
Movement: WASD for player 1, arrow keys for player 2 
Speed Boost: F for player 1, Slash key for player 2
Maze Swap: Left Shift for player 2, Right shift for player 2
